Description: BayesValidate implements the software validation method
        described in the paper "Validation of Software for Bayesian
        Models using Posterior Quantiles" (Cook, Gelman, and Rubin,
        2005).  It inputs a function to perform Bayesian inference as
        well as functions to generate data from the Bayesian model
        being fit, and repeatedly generates and analyzes data to check
        that the Bayesian inference program works properly.
